Phase 1: Set Up the GitHub Project (The Source)
Create a Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub.com and log in.

Click the + icon (top right) -> New Repository.

Repository name: jenkins-demo.

Public/Private: Choose Public (Easiest, so you don't need credentials in Jenkins).

Initialize with a README: Leave this UNCHECKED (Empty repo is better for this guide).

Click Create repository.

Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://github.com/YOUR_USER/jenkins-demo.git).

Set Up Local Project (Terminal): Open your Terminal and run these commands exactly as written:

Create the folder:

Bash

cd ~/Documents
mkdir Jenkins-Test-Project
cd Jenkins-Test-Project
Initialize Git:

Bash

git init
Create a dummy file:

Bash

echo "<h1>Hello Jenkins</h1>" > index.html
Connect to GitHub: (Replace the URL below with YOUR actual URL from Step 1)

Bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USER/jenkins-demo.git
Push the first version:

Bash

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Phase 2: Set Up Jenkins (The Engine)
Open Jenkins:

Go to http://localhost:8080.

Log in.

Create the Job:

Click New Item.

Item Name: Demo-Build.

Select Freestyle project.

Click OK.

Configure Source Code (Git):

Scroll down to Source Code Management.

Select Git.

Repository URL: Paste the GitHub URL you used in Phase 1.

Branch Specifier: Change */master to */main.

Configure the Trigger (Automation):

Scroll down to Build Triggers.

Check the box: Poll SCM.

Schedule: Enter five stars with spaces:

Plaintext

* * * * *
Configure the Build Step (The Action):

Scroll down to Build Steps.

Click Add build step -> Select Execute shell.

Command:

Bash

echo "Jenkins is successfully building!"
ls -la
Click Save.

Phase 3: The Final Test (The Trigger)
Now we prove it works.

Back to Terminal: Ensure you are still inside your Jenkins-Test-Project folder.

Make a Change: Add a new line to your file so Git sees a difference.

Bash

echo "Update for Jenkins Trigger" >> index.html
Push the Change: Run the standard Git push sequence:

Bash

git add .
git commit -m "Testing auto-build"
git push origin main
Watch Jenkins:

Switch to your Jenkins browser tab.

Don't click anything. Just watch the Build History on the left.

Wait up to 60 seconds.

A new build (e.g., #1) should appear automatically with a blue ball 🔵.
